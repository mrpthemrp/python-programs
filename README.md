## 1. Juice Box :beverage_box:
:link: **[Link to Program](/juicebox.py)**

This program creates a juice box drawing using :turtle: [Python Turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)!

The program is reliant on the user's input for the colours of the end result of the drawing. This program is simple in nature as it is meant to be an introductory exercise in using Python Turtle.

:desktop_computer: **Software Requirements**  
- Python 3.8 and up

:arrow_double_down: **Installation Instructions**  
*Make sure you have Python installed beforehand.*  

If you know how to run Python files from terminal, then feel free to skip this section. :)

1. **Click into the [file](/juicebox.py)**
2. Click **Raw**
    - You will be taken to a page with just the code.
3. **Right-click** and select **Save as..**
    - Alternatively just press **Ctrl+S**
4. The save pop-up window will appear, **Change 'Save file type as:' to 'All files'**
    - *This step is very important!* If not done properly the program will be saved as a .txt file instead of a .py file!
5. **Add '.py'** to the end of the filename
    - It should just be 'juicebox' on default
    - *The filename should be 'juicebox.py' before you save it.*
6. Determine which folder to save the program in and then **click 'Save'**
7. Locate the file after saving and **right-click** and select **'Edit in IDLE'** 
8. The program will now open (and be ready for editing), **press 'F5'** and the program will run!
